 /* I have decided not to implement Munro et al.'s scheme, as it is too
	* complicated and the overhead is not so small in practice. I have opted 
	* for a simpler scheme. Each open (closing) parenthesis will be able to
	* find its matching closing (open) parenthesis. If the distance is shorter
	* than b, we will do it by hand, traversing the string. Otherwise, the
	* answer will be stored in a hash table. In fact, only subtrees larger than 
	* s will have the full distance stored, while those between b and s will
	* be in another table with just log s bits. The traversal by hand proceeds
	* in fact by chunks of k bits, whose answers are precomputed.
	* Space: there cannot be more than n/s subtrees larger than s, idem b.
	* So we have (n/s)log n bits for far pointers and (n/b)log s for near 
	* pointers. The space for the table is 2^k*k*log b. The optimum s=b log n,
	* in which case the space is n/b(1 + log b + log log n) + 2^k*k*log b.
	* Time: the time is O(b/k), and we want to keep it O(log log n), so
	* k = b/log log n.
	* (previous arguments hold if there are no unary nodes, but we hope that 
	* there are not too many -- in revtrie we compress unary paths except when
	* they have id)
	* Settings: using b = log n, we have 
	* space = n log log n / log n + 2^(log n / log log n) log n
	* time = log log n
	* In practice: we use k = 8 (bytes table), b = W (so work = 4 or 8)
	* and space ~= n/3 + 10 Kbytes (fixed table). 
	* Notice that we need a hash table that stores only the deltas and does not
	* store the keys! (they would take log n instead of log s!). Collisions are
	* resolved as follows: see all the deltas that could be and pick the smallest
	* one whose excess is the same of the argument. To make this low we use a
	* load factor of 2.0, so it is 2n/3 after all.
	* We need the same for the reverses, for the forward is only for ('s and
	* reverses for )'s, so the proportion stays the same.
	* We also need the stream to be a bitmap to know how many open parentheses
	* we have to the left. The operations are as follows:
	* findclose: use the mechanism described above
	* findparent: similar, in reverse, looking for the current excess - 1
	* this needs us to store the (near/far) parent of each node, which may
	* cost more than the next sibling.
	* excess: using the number of open parentheses
	* enclose: almost findparent
