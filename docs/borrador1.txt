- Traditional process mining algorithms have problems dealing with event logs
- Data clustering is one of the most important fields of data mining
- problem of the detection of all the repeated patterns with a specific periodicity

- Web log mining has become very critical for effective web site management, creating adaptive Web sites, business and support services, personalization and so on [2].
- A web log is a sequence of pairs:


=== 
- The web data is typically unlabelled, dis- tributed, heterogeneous, semi-structured, time varying and high dimensional [2].
- With the exponential growth of WWW, there is imperative need for more efficient Web Access Pattern Mining algorithms.

- One particular WUM task is to predict the path of web pages that the user is going to traverse within a website. Accurately predicting the web user access behavior can minimize the user perception of latency, which is an important measure of the website quality of service [5,6,29]. This is achieved by fetching the web page before the user requests it. Another application is as a recommendation technique [20,30]: the prediction can be displayed to the user, giving an insight of what the user might be looking for, therefore improving the user’s experience.
- Access logs obtained from web servers are used to extract the user’s web site visit path

-In this paper we focus on improving the space consumption and time to perform queries on the web access sequences obtained from the web server logs used

	– Access(u, i) : Access the i-th web page visited by user u.
	– UserPath(u) : Return the complete path done by user u.
	– Count(P) : Count how many times path P has been performed in the col-
	lection.
	– MostCommonNextPage(P,k) : Return the k most common web pages vis-
	ited after path P.
	– ListUsers(P,k) : Return k distinct users that have followed path P.
	– MostFrequentPath(k,q) : Return the k most frequent paths of length q
	done by the users.
