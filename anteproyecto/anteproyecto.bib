  Abstract                 = {Or to analyze the performance of their systems in order to apply smart prefetching techniques for faster response, among other applications.

One particular WUM task is to predict the path of web pages that the user is going to traverse within a website.

Another application is as a recommendation technique


improving the user’s experience.


WUM and general data mining is to retrieve the top-k most frequent sequences


In this paper we focus on improving the space consumption and time to perform queries on the web access sequences obtained from the web server logs used during the first step, thus freeing resources for the second stage and therefore increasing the performance of the process.

Indexing Web Access Sequences

**
Our experiments show that our index uses about the same size of the plain representation of the data, and within this space supports various relevant operations within tens of microseconds.},
