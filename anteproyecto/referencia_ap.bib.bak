  Abstract                 = {We present a space-efficient data structure, based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, especially designed to handle web sequence logs, which are needed by web usage mining processes. Our index is able to process a set of operations efficiently, while at the same time maintains the original information in compressed form. Results show that web access logs can be represented using 0.85 to 1.03 times their original (plain) size, while executing most of the operations within a few tens of microseconds.},
