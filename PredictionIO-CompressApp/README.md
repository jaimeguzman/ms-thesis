# **PredictionIO-CompressApp**

The main Idea of this repo is use a losseless compression algorithm 
for make a engine model to predict with prediction.io.

**Lossless Compression Algorithm:**
- Lempel Ziv 78
- Lempel Ziv W

**Based on:**

This repo use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and the community [PredictionIO-Vagrant](https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO-Vagrant). 

[PredictionIO](https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO) is an open source machine learning framework for developers and data scientists. It supports event collection, deployment of algorithms, evaluation, querying predictive results via REST APIs. Check out http://prediction.io!
