  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with algorithms for prediction of discrete sequences over a finite alphabet, using variable order Markov models. The class of such algorithms is large and in principle includes any lossless compression algorithm. We focus on six prominent prediction algorithms, including Context Tree Weighting (CTW), Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) and Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PSTs). We discuss the properties of these algorithms and compare their performance using real life sequences from three domains: proteins, English text and music pieces. The comparison is made with respect to prediction quality as measured by the average log-loss. We also compare classification algorithms based on these predictors with respect to a number of large protein classification tasks. Our results indicate that a "decomposed" CTW (a variant of the CTW algorithm) and PPM outperform all other algorithms in sequence prediction tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, a different algorithm, which is a modification of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, significantly outperforms all algorithms on the protein classification problems.},

This paper first analyses the association-rules-based personalized recommender model which is very popular in web site recommender system, points out the limitation of the frequent access path algorithm in this model, and then improves it. At last, the paper shows by the test results that the improved algorithm can advance the recommending quality.},

One particular WUM task is to predict the path of web pages that the user is going to traverse within a website.
Another application is as a recommendation technique

improving the user’s experience.

WUM and general data mining is to retrieve the top-k most frequent sequences

In this paper we focus on improving the space consumption and time to perform queries on the web access sequences obtained from the web server logs used during the first step, thus freeing resources for the second stage and therefore increasing the performance of the process.
Indexing Web Access Sequences
** Our experiments show that our index uses about the same size of the plain representation of the data, and within this space supports various relevant operations within tens of microseconds.},

  Abstract                 = {Web prefetching techniques have been pointed out to be especially important to reduce perceived web latencies and, consequently, an important amount of work can be found in the open literature. But, in general, it is not possible to do a fair comparison among the proposed prefetching techniques due to three main reasons: (i) the underlying baseline system where prefetching is applied differs widely among the studies; (ii) the workload used in the presented experiments is not the same; (iii) different performance key metrics are used to evaluate their benefits. This paper focuses on the third reason. Our main concern is to identify which are the meaningful indexes when studying the performance of different prefetching techniques. For this purpose, we propose a taxonomy based on three categories, which permits us to identify analogies and differences among the indexes commonly used. In order to check, in a more formal way, the relation between them, we run experiments and estimate statistically the correlation among a representative subset of those metrics. The statistical results help us to suggest which indexes should be selected when performing evaluation studies depending on the different elements in the considered web architecture. The choice of the appropriate key metric is of paramount importance for a correct and representative study. As our experimental results show, depending on the metric used to check the system performance, results cannot only widely vary but also reach opposite conclusions. },

These factors might give us more accu- rate prediction performance for Web access.

  Abstract                 = {Web sites may contain numerous documents. Using some web techniques, it's possible to analyze users' data about using resources, contents of those documents and structure of web sites. Adaptive web sites automatically change their structure and representation based on visitor's behavior. Shortcutting is an approach that enables connecting two documents which has never been connected before. Most of existing approaches enables connecting the first and the last document in user's navigation path, not considering the possibility that some of the documents within the navigation path might contain useful information for reaching intended document. These documents, which are positioned within user's navigation path, are called wayposts, and they may contain useful information that can help users to get to the specific ìtargetî document. The goal of this paperwork is to discuss about all the possibilities of identifying those waypost documents in users' navigation paths and to propose an optimization of navigation structure of a web site based on users' navigation paths, initial and target documents.},

  Abstract                 = {The tremendous progress of the internet and the World Wide Web in the recent era has emphasized the requirement for reducing the latency at the client or the user end. In general, caching and prefetching techniques are used to reduce the delay experienced by the user while waiting to get the web page from the remote web server. The present paper attempts to solve the problem of predicting the next page to be accessed by the user based on the mining of web server logs that maintains the information of users who access the web site. The prediction of next page to be visited by the user may be pre fetched by the browser which in turn reduces the latency for user. Thus analyzing user's past behavior to predict the future web pages to be navigated by the user is of great importance. The proposed model yields good prediction accuracy compared to the existing methods like Markov model, association rule, ANN etc.},
