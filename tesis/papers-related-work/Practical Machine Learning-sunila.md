Machine learning
Machine learning has been around for many years now and all social media users, at some point in time, have been consumers of Machine learning technology. One of the common examples is face recognition software, which is the capability to identify whether a digital photograph includes a given person. Today, Facebook users can see automatic suggestions to tag their friends in the digital photographs that are uploaded. Some cameras and software such as iPhoto also have this capability. There are many examples and use cases that will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

##Definition


"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T,  as measured by P, improves with experience E." --Tom M. Mitchell


"Machine learning is the training of a model from data that generalizes a decision against a performance measure."  --Jason Brownlee


"Machine learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data, such as from sensor data or databases." --Wikipedia


 single term or definition for Machine learning is the key to facilitating the definition of a problem-solving platform. Basically, it is a mechanism for pattern search and building intelligence into a machine to be able to learn, implying that it will be able to do better in the future from its own experience.


 Machine learning algorithms that are constructed this way handle building intelligence. Essentially, machines make sense of data in much the same way that humans do.

 DATA
Data forms the main source of learning in Machine learning. The data that is being referenced here can be in any format, can be received at any frequency, and can be of any size. When it comes to handling large datasets in the Machine learning context, there are some new techniques that have evolved and are being experimented with. There are also more big data aspects, including parallel processing, distributed storage, and execution. More on the large-scale aspects of data will be covered in the next chapter, including some unique differentiators.

When we think of data, dimensions come to mind. To start with, we have rows and columns when it comes to structured and unstructured data. This book will cover handling both structured and unstructured data in the machine learning context. In this section, we will cover the terminology related to data within the Machine learning context.
