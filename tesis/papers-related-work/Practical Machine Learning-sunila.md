Machine learning
Machine learning has been around for many years now and all social media users, at some point in time, have been consumers of Machine learning technology. One of the common examples is face recognition software, which is the capability to identify whether a digital photograph includes a given person. Today, Facebook users can see automatic suggestions to tag their friends in the digital photographs that are uploaded. Some cameras and software such as iPhoto also have this capability. There are many examples and use cases that will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

##Definition


"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T,  as measured by P, improves with experience E." --Tom M. Mitchell


"Machine learning is the training of a model from data that generalizes a decision against a performance measure."  --Jason Brownlee


"Machine learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data, such as from sensor data or databases." --Wikipedia


 single term or definition for Machine learning is the key to facilitating the definition of a problem-solving platform. 

 Basically, it is a mechanism for pattern search and building intelligence into a machine to be able to learn, implying that it will be able to do better in the future from its own experience.


 Machine learning algorithms that are constructed this way handle building intelligence. Essentially, machines make sense of data in much the same way that humans do.

 DATA
Data forms the main source of learning in Machine learning. The data that is being referenced here can be in any format, can be received at any frequency, and can be of any size. When it comes to handling large datasets in the Machine learning context, there are some new techniques that have evolved and are being experimented with. There are also more big data aspects, including parallel processing, distributed storage, and execution. More on the large-scale aspects of data will be covered in the next chapter, including some unique differentiators.

When we think of data, dimensions come to mind. To start with, we have rows and columns when it comes to structured and unstructured data. This book will cover handling both structured and unstructured data in the machine learning context. In this section, we will cover the terminology related to data within the Machine learning context.


Geometric models
Geometric models use geometric concepts such as lines, planes, and distances. These models usually operate, or can operate, on high volumes of data. Usually, linear transformations help compare different Machine learning methods:



Probabilistic models
Probabilistic models are statistical models that employ statistical techniques. These models are based on a strategy that defines the relationship between two variables. This relationship can be derived for sure as this involves using a random background process. In most cases, a subset of the overall data can be considered for processing:




Data and inconsistencies in Machine learning
This section details all the possible data inconsistencies that may be encountered while implementing Machine learning projects, such as:

Under-fitting
Over-fitting
Data instability
Unpredictable future
Fortunately, there are some established processes in place today to address these inconsistencies. The following sections cover these inconsistencies.



UNPREDICTABLE DATA FORMATS
Machine learning is meant to work with new data constantly coming into the system and learning from that data. Complexity will creep in when the new data entering the system comes in formats that are not supported by the machine learning system. It is now difficult to say if our models work well for the new data given the instability in the formats that we receive the data, unless there is a mechanism built to handle this.
