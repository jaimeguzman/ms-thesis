#ABSTRACT

We develop the notion of normalized information dis- tance (NID) [7] into a kernel distance suitable for use with a Support Vector Machine classifier, and demon- strate its use for an audio genre classification task. Our classification scheme involves a relatively small number of low-level audio features, is efficient to compute, yet generates an accuracy which compares well with recent works.







# COSAS DE ML


A wide variety of classifiers are available for the sec- ond stage, e.g. Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) as described in [3,9,10]. Artificial Neural Net- works (ANNs) and learning tree vector quantizer have also been used [11,12].


# EXPLORACION DE HMM HACIA SEQUENCIAS


# LO QUE HICIERON 

Specifically, we present a new class of string kernel, which is based on Lempel-Ziv-type coding algorithm [16], and use it to drive an SVM classifier for music genre classification


# CONCEPTO 

SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm, which maps data into a high dimensional feature space where data is more likely to be linearly separable.


# ENCHULANDO SVM CON LZ



It oc- curred to us that we could use the dictionaries generated by an LZ78 parser to identify commonly occurring words in a sequence, and then use a string-kernel like approach to drive an SVM classifier.


# LA REPRESENTACION DISCRETA QUE SE PUEDE USAR CON LZ

It works by identi- fying patterns, called phrases, of the data and stores them in a dictionary (i.e. encoding table) that defines commonly occurring substrings, and associates them with dictionary indexes that are used to represent the phrases in the compressed output

LZ78 parsing produce a set of features with varying length (2) it identifies increasingly long initial portions of repeated phrases gradually: that is, it will need to see a phrase of length L on L occasions before it remembers the whole phrase in its dictionary.
